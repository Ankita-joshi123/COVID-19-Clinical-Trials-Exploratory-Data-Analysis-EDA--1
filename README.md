# COVID-19 Clinical Trials – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on **COVID-19 clinical trials data** to understand study characteristics, trial phases, enrollment patterns, intervention types, and geographical distribution.

The analysis helps identify **trends, gaps, and insights** in COVID-19 clinical research using structured data analysis techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the **distribution of COVID-19 clinical trials**
- Analyze **study phases, status, and enrollment**
- Explore **intervention types** (Drug, Biological, Device, etc.)
- Identify **country-wise and region-wise trial distribution**
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing**
- Generate **visual insights** to support decision-making

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: Public COVID-19 Clinical Trials data  
- Format: CSV  
- Key Variables:
  - Study Title
  - Study Status
  - Phase
  - Enrollment
  - Intervention Type
  - Sponsor
  - Country / Location

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas (Data Manipulation)
- NumPy (Numerical Operations)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Missing value handling and data cleaning
- Frequency distribution analysis
- Phase-wise trial comparison
- Enrollment trend analysis
- Country-wise clinical trial distribution
- Visualization using bar charts, pie charts, and histograms

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Majority of trials are in **Phase 2 and Phase 3**
- Drug-based interventions dominate COVID-19 trials
- Highest number of trials conducted in **USA, India, and Europe**
- Many trials have **unknown or missing enrollment values**, highlighting data quality issues
